# _discogs decisive_
Generate at random **three albums** from your Discogs vinyl collection to help you decide what to listen to next! All you need to do is tell me what genre you are craving...

Trust me. As a record collector for 10 years now, I find myself being indecisive when choosing what to listen to next! Luckily, Python and Discogs made it a little easier for us all.

## Installation

**PYTHON 3**

Log into your Discogs account and generate a user token at https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers 

After you generate a token, input your token on line 28 of the script.

Next, install discogs_client, six, pyfiglet, and inquirer via pip3

```bash
pip3 install discogs_client, six, pyfiglet, inquirer
```

Now you are ready to generate any three random albums:

```bash
python3 discogs_decisive.py
```

3 randomly selected album/artist will appear.

## Usage

I use this script to help me pick what record to spin next when I can't decide.
